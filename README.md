Pyhthon code to generate Ulam spirals to visualise primes.
Uses Numpy which is widely available.  Code is packaged in Jupyter notebook.
Subsets of Primes include Twin Primes, Sophie Germain Primes, Isolated Primes, Palindromic Primes, Emirp Primes, and combinations of these primes.
The resulting visuals give interesting results and provide intuition on the density of primes.
I tried Mersenne primes but the visual wasn't satisfactory given their rarity.
