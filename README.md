Pyhthon code to generate Ulam spirals to visualise primes.
Uses Numpy which is widely available.  Code is packaged in Jupyter notebook.
Subsets of Primes include Twin Primes, Sophie Germain Primes, Isolated Primes, Palindromic Primes, Emirp Primes, and combinations of these primes.
The resulting visuals give interesting results and provide intuition on the density of primes.
I tried Mersenne primes but the visual wasn't satisfactory given their rarity.
The Emirp prime visual is at first surprising but one recalls that all large primes end in 1, 3, 7, 9 and not 2, 5.  This explains the gaps in some of the concentric squares.
